# GlyphForge
Generate the glyphs based off [Gorilla of Denstiny](https://github.com/GorillaOfDestiny)'s science of magic system

# Usage
1. Run the `app.py` file
2. Fill in the dropdown boxes with desired values
3. Click the `Generate Glyph` button.

# Issues
The code does all work, however the durations break if you go past "dispelled" and idk

# DISCLAIMER
I DID NOT DO ANY OF THE MATH AND MOST OF THE CODE IS NOT MINE. I JUST MADE IT INTO A PYTHON GUI APP.
