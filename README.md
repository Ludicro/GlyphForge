# GlyphForge
Generate the glyphs based off [Gorilla of Denstiny](https://github.com/GorillaOfDestiny)'s science of magic system

# Usage
1. Run the `app.py` file
2. Fill in the dropdown boxes with desired values
3. Click the `Generate Glyph` button.

OR

1. Run the `app.py` file
2. Click the `Random Spell` button to generate a random glyph.

## Current Development
I have the app where conditions exist - however I think this might not be needed if this is restricted to just wizard spells which I am testing.

But first I have to catalog all the currently available spells which is draining my soul

# DISCLAIMER
I did not create any of the algorithms used in the backend of this program. I exclusively made the GUI and assembled the JSONs used in the spell lookup. Aside from slight modifications, I have done nothing to the `bases.py`, `line_shapes.py`, and `writer.py` files.
